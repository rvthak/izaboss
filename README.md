__The program was Developed on pop!_os 19.10 64-bit__
__The compiler used during development is g++__

=> For simplicity we chose to build the program using a makefile
> Compile the program using command:
    make

> Debug the program using commands:
    make gdb 	// for gdb
    make vg		// for valgrind
( There are more sophisticated options available for memory leaks, read the makefile itself )

> Clean the object files with:
    make clean

> Run the program with:
    ./l5r
